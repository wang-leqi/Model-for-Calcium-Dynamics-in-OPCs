# Modeling OPC calcium 

## + ATP and Glutamate channels P2X7, ampa, and nmda.
 This github page contains python code to generate time series simulation; XPP code to genrate bifurcation diagrams, and matlab to plot bifurcation.
 
 ## Subfolders:
 **BifSSM**: matlab code for reading xpp output and plot bifurction diagrams in plotbif.m, others are support functions for read data matrix ouput from xpp. 
 
  **diagram**: .dat file from xpp, and some final output graphs. 
  **notes**:some analysis for the project.
  **python**: This folder contains a parallel version from Martin, but divided into different modules.  
  **xpp** xpp code to generate bifurcation diagram
